# P-DRL_formation_control
There is a method of P-DRL for multi-UAVs formation control

The implementation of the P-DRL drone formation control method mainly consists of two parts: 
one is the communication-request module on the drone（based on the MCU in the UAV）, 
The other is the model training and synergetic decision-making module in the ground control center (based on a computer)
